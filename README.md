# Project: A simple movies recommendation engine using k-means clustering

In this project I have implemented a k-means clustering algorithm to explore the similarities and differences in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies. This algorithm is a simplistic recommendation engine that shows the most basic idea of "collaborative filtering".

The data I have used comes from the wonderful MovieLens user rating dataset.

This project is from Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegre.

For more info see `simple-recommendation-engine.ipynb` file.

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Files

`simple-recommendation-engine.ipynb`: notebook file with coding and explanation about the project. 
`ml-latest-small`: File with a dataset that describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service.
`helper.py`: File with auxiliar methods used in notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `
simple-movies-recommendation-engine/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook simple-movies-recommendation-engine.ipynb
```  

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
